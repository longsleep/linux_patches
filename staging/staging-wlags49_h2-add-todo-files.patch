+First of all, the best thing would be that this driver becomes obsolte by
+adding support for Hermes II and Hermes II.5 cards to the existing orinoco
+driver. The orinoco driver currently only supports Hermes I based cards.
+Since this will not happen by magic and has not happend until now this
+driver provides a stop-gap solution for these type of cards.
+
+Having said that, the following wishlist comes to mind to make the driver
+suitable as fully supported kernel driver. Feel free to expand/enhance the
+list.
+
+TODO:
+	- verify against a Hermes II.5 card
+	- verify with WPA encription (both with H2 and H2.5 cards)
+	- sometimes the card does not initialize correctly, retry mechanisms
+	  are build in to catch most cases but not all
+	- once the driver runs it is very stable, but I have the impression
+	  some the crittical sections take to long
+	- the driver is split into a Hermes II and a Hermes II.5 part, it
+	  would be nice to handle both with one module instead of two
+	- review by the wireless developer community
+	- verify the code against the coding standards for a propper linux
+	  driver
+	- resolve license issues (?)
+
+DONE:
+	- verified against a Hermes II card (Thomson Speedtouch 110 PCMCIA
+	  card)
+	- verified with WEP encription
+
+Please send any patches or complaints about this driver to Greg
+Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and Cc: Henk de Groot <pe1dnn@amsat.org>
+Don't bother the upstream wireless kernel developers about it, they
+want nothing to do with it.
