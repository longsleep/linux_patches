 	- move firmware loading to request_firmware()
 	- remove direct memory access of structures
 	- any remaining sparse and checkpatch.pl warnings
-	- any netdev recommended changes

+	- use net_device_ops
+	- use dev->stats rather than adapter->stats
+	- don't cast netdev_priv it is already void
+	- use compare_ether_addr
+	- GET RID OF MACROS
+	- work on all architectures
+	   - without CONFIG_X86_64 confusion
+	   - do 64 bit correctly
+	   - don't depend on order of union
+	- get rid of ASSERT(), use BUG() instead but only where necessary
+	  looks like most aren't really useful
+	- no new SIOCDEVPRIVATE ioctl allowed
+	- don't use module_param for configuring interrupt mitigation
+	  use ethtool instead
+	- reorder code to elminate use of forward declarations
+	- don't keep private linked list of drivers.
+	- remove all the gratiutous debug infrastructure
+	- use PCI_DEVICE()
+	- do ethtool correctly using ethtool_ops
+	- NAPI?
+	- wasted overhead of extra stats
+	- state variables for things that are
+	  easily availble and shouldn't be kept in card structure, cardnum, ...
+	  slotnumber, events, ...
+	- get rid of slic_spinlock wrapper
+	- volatile == bad design => bad code
+	- locking too fine grained, not designed just throw more locks
+	  at problem
