Subject: Staging: comedi: usbdux.c: fix locking up of the driver when the comedi ringbuffer runs empty
To: gregkh@suse.de
Message-ID: <4B0FBF75.1010108@f2s.com>


Jan-Matthias Braun spotted a bug which locks up the driver when the
comedi ring buffer runs empty and provided a patch. The driver would
still send the data to comedi but the reader won't wake up any more.
What's required is setting the flag COMEDI_CB_BLOCK after new data has
arrived which wakes up the reader and therefore the read() command.
