Subject: Staging: rtl8192su: add device ids
To: greg@kroah.com
Message-ID: <20100608014713.GD13449@localhost.localdomain>
Content-Disposition: inline


This patch adds some device ids.
The list of supported devices was extracted from realteks driver package.
(0x050d, 0x815F) and (0x0df6, 0x004b) are not in the official list of
supported devices  and may not work correctly.
In case of problems with these, they should probably be removed from the list.
