Subject: kobject warning stuff

Good for development, don't push it to mainline as there are too many
false positives.

There are 2 changes in this patch.

First one is to ensure that the kobject is properly initialized _before_
kobject_init() is called.  Yeah, seems funny, right?  Turns out this has
caught a lot of issues where kobject_init() is called twice on the same
object, not a good thing at all.

The second change in that patch tries to enforce the "everything needs a
release() function" rule for kobjects, but it turns out, a lot of static
kobjects trigger this inproperly (struct bus and friends), so that can't
go to mainline, and it only shows up if you enable CONFIG_KOBJECT_DEBUG.
