- * device_create - creates a device and registers it with sysfs
- * @class: pointer to the struct class that this device should be registered to
- * @parent: pointer to the parent struct device of this new device, if any
- * @devt: the dev_t for the char device to be added
- * @fmt: string for the device's name
- *
- * This function can be used by char device classes.  A struct device
- * will be created in sysfs, registered to the specified class.
- *
- * A "dev" file will be created, showing the dev_t for the device, if
- * the dev_t is not 0,0.
- * If a pointer to a parent struct device is passed in, the newly created
- * struct device will be a child of that device in sysfs.
- * The pointer to the struct device will be returned from the call.
- * Any further sysfs files that might be required can be created using this
- * pointer.
- *
- * Note: the struct class passed to this function must have previously
- * been created with a call to class_create().
