Subject: Driver core: Clarify device cleanup.
To: Greg K-H <greg@kroah.com>
Message-ID: <20080903182640.14279526@gondolin.boeblingen.de.ibm.com>

From: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>

Make the comments on how to use device_initialize(), device_add()
and device_register() a bit clearer - in particular, explicitly
note that put_device() must be used once we tried to add the device
to the hierarchy.
