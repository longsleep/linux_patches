Subject: sysdev: detect multiple driver registrations

From: Ben Dooks <ben@fluff.org>

I've just found how easy it is to accidentally register a sysdev_driver for
two different classes.  When this happens, bad things happen as the
sysdev_driver structure keeps has the list entry for the driver
registration.

The following patch makes a WARN_ON() if this happens, although I think
BUG_ON or returning -EAGAIN could also be valid responses to this.
