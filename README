This is greg k-h's patch tree

It is currently used to maintain and develop the following subsystems:
	- USB
	- Driver core
	- Kobjects
	- misc things around the driver core and kobjects
	- debugfs
	- drivers/staging (i.e. the "crap" tree).

This tree is a set of patches, in quilt format[1] that are to be applied
to the latest kernel version.  For more information on how to use this
set of patches, see the section USING below.

This tree is being managed by Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
Please contact him for any questions relating to the code contained
within it, or any procedures relating to these patches.


WHY NOT GIT?

Well, it is using git, just a quilt tree using git :)

It is easier for me to maintain patches in quilt and then use git to
send patches to Linus for merging, than it is to keep everything in a
single git tree with different branches.  This is because quilt allows
me to add and remove patches within the middle of series, and other
things that are very useful for this kind of development workflow.

USING

This tree is sucked into every linux-next release.  If you wish to use
git, it is probably easier to base code off of the last linux-next tree
and send me patches against that, than it might be to use this quilt
tree.

To use this tree, you should have git and quilt installed.  Another very
useful tool is ketchup[2], which makes it simple to download the Linux
kernel source of any version.  You are not required to use ketchup, but
the series of steps below assume that you are using it.

Clone the patches git tree:
  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/patches.git

Create a kernel directory to apply these patches to:
  mkdir linux
  cd linux
  ketchup `cat ../patches/version`

Then push the tree of patches onto the created kernel tree:
  QUILT_PATCHES=../patches/ quilt push -a

Now build and test the kernel as usual.

It is easiest to create a new patch at the end of the tree if you wish
for me to be able to accept it as a patch against a patch is difficult
to merge, but an add-on patch is quite easy.



[1] quilt can be found included in all Linux distros, and its home page
    is at http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt

    included in most Linux distros.
