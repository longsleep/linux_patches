This is Simon Eisenmann"s (longsleep) patch tree for:
  - Ubuntu Saucy Kernel (3.11.3)

It is currently used to maintain and develop the following subsystems:
  - Chromebook Pixel kernel patches

This tree is a set of patches, in quilt format[1] that are to be applied
to the latest kernel version.  For more information on how to use this
set of patches, see the section USING below.

This tree is being managed by Simon Eisenmann <simon@longsleep.org>
Please contact him for any questions relating to the code contained
within it, or any procedures relating to these patches.

The tree style is based on the tree provided by Greg Kroah-Hartman 
<gregkh@suse.de>. Thank you for this great idea to maintain kernel
patches with quilt. 


USING

To use this tree, you should have git and quilt installed.

Clone the my patches git tree

Then push the tree of patches onto the a kernel tree:
  QUILT_PATCHES=../patches/ quilt push -a

Now build and test the kernel as usual. See 
 
  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild

Short instructions

  cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
  make oldconfig
  make clean
  CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN` fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers
