From: Jiri Slaby <jirislaby@gmail.com>

- remove changelog from the file. we don't care about ancient
  history
- update copyright year
- update version
- constify some stuff
- empty lines removal
- unused variables and macros removal
- remove some asm/ includes, they are sucked by linux/ variants

- * small changes;  this should yield smoother output
- *
- * Revision 1.30  1994/11/16  04:28:05  bentson
- * Fix from Corey Minyard, Internet: minyard@metronet.com,
- * UUCP: minyard@wf-rch.cirr.com, WORK: minyardbnr.ca, to
- * cy_hangup that appears to clear up much (all?) of the
- * DTR glitches; also he's added/cleaned-up diagnostic messages
- *
- * Revision 1.29  1994/11/16  04:16:07  bentson
- * add change proposed by Ralph Sims, ralphs@halcyon.com, to
- * operate higher speeds in same way as other serial ports;
- * add more serial ports (for up to two 16-port muxes).
- *
- * Revision 1.28  1994/11/04  00:13:16  root
- * turn off diagnostic messages
- *
- * Revision 1.27  1994/11/03  23:46:37  root
- * bunch of changes to bring driver into greater conformance
- * with the serial.c driver (looking for missed fixes)
- *
- * Revision 1.26  1994/11/03  22:40:36  root
- * automatic interrupt probing fixed.
- *
- * Revision 1.25  1994/11/03  20:17:02  root
- * start to implement auto-irq
- *
- * Revision 1.24  1994/11/03  18:01:55  root
- * still working on modem signals--trying not to drop DTR
- * during the getty/login processes
- *
- * Revision 1.23  1994/11/03  17:51:36  root
- * extend baud rate support; set receive threshold as function
- * of baud rate; fix some problems with RTS/CTS;
- *
- * Revision 1.22  1994/11/02  18:05:35  root
- * changed arguments to udelay to type long to get
- * delays to be of correct duration
- *
- * Revision 1.21  1994/11/02  17:37:30  root
- * employ udelay (after calibrating loops_per_second earlier
- * in init/main.c) instead of using home-grown delay routines
- *
- * Revision 1.20  1994/11/02  03:11:38  root
- * cy_chars_in_buffer forces a return value of 0 to let
- * login work (don't know why it does); some functions
- * that were returning EFAULT, now executes the code;
- * more work on deciding when to disable xmit interrupts;
- *
- * Revision 1.19  1994/11/01  20:10:14  root
- * define routine to start transmission interrupts (by enabling
- * transmit interrupts); directly enable/disable modem interrupts;
- *
- * Revision 1.18  1994/11/01  18:40:45  bentson
- * Don't always enable transmit interrupts in startup; interrupt on
- * TxMpty instead of TxRdy to help characters get out before shutdown;
- * restructure xmit interrupt to check for chars first and quit if
- * none are ready to go; modem status (MXVRx) is upright, _not_ inverted
- * (to my view);
- *
- * Revision 1.17  1994/10/30  04:39:45  bentson
- * rename serial_driver and callout_driver to cy_serial_driver and
- * cy_callout_driver to avoid linkage interference; initialize
- * info->type to PORT_CIRRUS; ruggedize paranoia test; elide ->port
- * from cyclades_port structure; add paranoia check to cy_close;
- *
- * Revision 1.16  1994/10/30  01:14:33  bentson
- * change major numbers; add some _early_ return statements;
- *
- * Revision 1.15  1994/10/29  06:43:15  bentson
- * final tidying up for clean compile;  enable some error reporting
- *
- * Revision 1.14  1994/10/28  20:30:22  Bentson
- * lots of changes to drag the driver towards the new tty_io
- * structures and operation.  not expected to work, but may
- * compile cleanly.
- *
- * Revision 1.13  1994/07/21  23:08:57  Bentson
- * add some diagnostic cruft; support 24 lines (for testing
- * both -8Y and -16Y cards; be more thorough in servicing all
- * chips during interrupt; add "volatile" a few places to
- * circumvent compiler optimizations; fix base & offset
- * computations in block_til_ready (was causing chip 0 to
- * stop operation)
- *
- * Revision 1.12  1994/07/19  16:42:11  Bentson
- * add some hackery for kernel version 1.1.8; expand
- * error messages; refine timing for delay loops and
- * declare loop params volatile
- *
- * Revision 1.11  1994/06/11  21:53:10  bentson
- * get use of save_car right in transmit interrupt service
- *
- * Revision 1.10.1.1  1994/06/11  21:31:18  bentson
- * add some diagnostic printing; try to fix save_car stuff
- *
- * Revision 1.10  1994/06/11  20:36:08  bentson
- * clean up compiler warnings
- *
- * Revision 1.9  1994/06/11  19:42:46  bentson
- * added a bunch of code to support modem signalling
- *
- * Revision 1.8  1994/06/11  17:57:07  bentson
- * recognize break & parity error
- *
- * Revision 1.7  1994/06/05  05:51:34  bentson
- * Reorder baud table to be monotonic; add cli to CP; discard
- * incoming characters and status if the line isn't open; start to
- * fold code into cy_throttle; start to port get_serial_info,
- * set_serial_info, get_modem_info, set_modem_info, and send_break
- * from serial.c; expand cy_ioctl; relocate and expand config_setup;
- * get flow control characters from tty struct; invalidate ports w/o
- * hardware;
- *
- * Revision 1.6  1994/05/31  18:42:21  bentson
- * add a loop-breaker in the interrupt service routine;
- * note when port is initialized so that it can be shut
- * down under the right conditions; receive works without
- * any obvious errors
- *
- * Revision 1.5  1994/05/30  00:55:02  bentson
- * transmit works without obvious errors
- *
- * Revision 1.4  1994/05/27  18:46:27  bentson
- * incorporated more code from lib_y.c; can now print short
- * strings under interrupt control to port zero; seems to
- * select ports/channels/lines correctly
- *
- * Revision 1.3  1994/05/25  22:12:44  bentson
- * shifting from multi-port on a card to proper multiplexor
- * data structures;  added skeletons of most routines
- *
- * Revision 1.2  1994/05/19  13:21:43  bentson
- * start to crib from other sources
- *
