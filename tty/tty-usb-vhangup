Subject: tty: USB hangup is racy

From: Alan Cox <alan@linux.intel.com>

The USB layer uses tty_hangup to deal with unplugs of the physical hardware
(analogous to loss of carrier) and then frees the resources. However the
tty_hangup is asynchronous. As the hangup can sleep we can use tty_vhangup
which is the non async version to avoid freeing resources too early.
