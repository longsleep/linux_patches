Subject: driver core: Introduce device_create_groups

From: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>

device_create_groups lets callers create devices as well as associated
sysfs attributes with a single call. This avoids race conditions seen
if sysfs attributes on new devices are created later.

[fixed up comment block placement and add checks for printk buffer
formats - gregkh]
