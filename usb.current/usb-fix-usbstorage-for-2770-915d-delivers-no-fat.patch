Resolves kernel.org bug 14914.

Remove entry for 2770:915d (usb digital camera with mass storage
support) from unusual_devs.h. The fix triggered by the entry causes
the file system on the camera to be completely inaccessible (no
partition table, the device is not mountable).

The patch works, but let me clarify a few things about it.  All the
patch does is remove the entry for this device from the
drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h, which is supposed to help with a
problem with the device's reported size (I think).  I'm pretty sure it
was originally added for a reason, so I'm not sure removing it won't
cause other problems to reappear.  Also, I should note that this
unusual_devs.h entry was present (and activating workarounds) in
2.6.29, but in that version everything works fine.  Starting with
2.6.30, things no longer work.
