Subject: USB: OHCI: don't look at the root hub to get the number of ports
To: Greg KH <greg@kroah.com>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44L0.1004201036020.1837-100000@iolanthe.rowland.org>


This patch (as1371) fixes a small bug in ohci-hcd.  The HCD already
knows how many ports the controller has; there's no need to go looking
at the root hub's usb_device structure to find out.  Especially since
the root hub's maxchild value is set correctly only while the root hub
is bound to the hub driver.
