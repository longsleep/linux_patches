Subject: USB: xhci: Don't touch xhci_td after it's freed.

On a successful transfer, urb->td is freed before the URB is ready to be
given back to the driver.  Don't touch urb->td after it's freed.  This bug
would have only shown up when xHCI debugging was turned on, and the freed
memory was quickly reused for something else.
