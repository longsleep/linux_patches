-What:	dev->power.power_state
-When:	July 2007
-Why:	Broken design for runtime control over driver power states, confusing
-	driver-internal runtime power management with:  mechanisms to support
-	system-wide sleep state transitions; event codes that distinguish
-	different phases of swsusp "sleep" transitions; and userspace policy
-	inputs.  This framework was never widely used, and most attempts to
-	use it were broken.  Drivers should instead be exposing domain-specific
-	interfaces either to kernel or to userspace.

 What:	old NCR53C9x driver
 When:	October 2007
 Why:	Replaced by the much better esp_scsi driver.  Actual low-level
