Subject: usb: introduce usb_device authorization bits
To: gregkh@kroah.com, "Alan Stern" <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>, "David Brownell" <david-b@pacbell.net>, linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Message-ID: <20070718214242.610651098@sodium.jf.intel.com>


This just modifies 'struct usb_device' to contain the 'authorized'
bit. It also adds a 'wusb' bit. This is needed because nonauthorized
(and thus non-authenticated) wusb devices will fail certain kind of
simple requests (such as string descriptors). By knowing the device is
WUSB, we just avoid them.
