Subject: USB: cxacru: document how to interact with the flash memory
To: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
Message-ID: <4B080355.8000300@simon.arlott.org.uk>


These commands were found by accident... fortunately
it still works even if the flash memory is erased,
despite having no USB device IDs.

Some example sysfs code for raw command access:
