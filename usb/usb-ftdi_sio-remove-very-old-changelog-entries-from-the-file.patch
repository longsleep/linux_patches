Subject: USB: ftdi_sio: remove very old changelog entries from the file.

People keep trying to add entries to this section of the driver for
things.  That's what the Changelog is supposed to be for, not the .c
file.

  * See http://ftdi-usb-sio.sourceforge.net for upto date testing info
  *	and extra documentation
  *
- * (21/Jul/2004) Ian Abbott
- *      Incorporated Steven Turner's code to add support for the FT2232C chip.
- *      The prelimilary port to the 2.6 kernel was by Rus V. Brushkoff.  I have
- *      fixed a couple of things.
- *
- * (27/May/2004) Ian Abbott
- *      Improved throttling code, mostly stolen from the WhiteHEAT driver.
- *
- * (26/Mar/2004) Jan Capek
- *      Added PID's for ICD-U20/ICD-U40 - incircuit PIC debuggers from CCS Inc.
- *
- * (09/Feb/2004) Ian Abbott
- *      Changed full name of USB-UIRT device to avoid "/" character.
- *      Added FTDI's alternate PID (0x6006) for FT232/245 devices.
- *      Added PID for "ELV USB Module UO100" from Stefan Frings.
- *
- * (21/Oct/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Renamed some VID/PID macros for Matrix Orbital and Perle Systems
- *      devices.  Removed Matrix Orbital and Perle Systems devices from the
- *      8U232AM device table, but left them in the FT232BM table, as they are
- *      known to use only FT232BM.
- *
- * (17/Oct/2003) Scott Allen
- *      Added vid/pid for Perle Systems UltraPort USB serial converters
- *
- * (21/Sep/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Added VID/PID for Omnidirectional Control Technology US101 USB to
- *      RS-232 adapter (also rebadged as Dick Smith Electronics XH6381).
- *      VID/PID supplied by Donald Gordon.
- *
- * (19/Aug/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Freed urb's transfer buffer in write bulk callback.
- *      Omitted some paranoid checks in write bulk callback that don't matter.
- *      Scheduled work in write bulk callback regardless of port's open count.
- *
- * (05/Aug/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Added VID/PID for ID TECH IDT1221U USB to RS-232 adapter.
- *      VID/PID provided by Steve Briggs.
- *
- * (23/Jul/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Added PIDs for CrystalFontz 547, 633, 631, 635, 640 and 640 from
- *      Wayne Wylupski.
- *
- * (10/Jul/2003) David Glance
- *      Added PID for DSS-20 SyncStation cradle for Sony-Ericsson P800.
- *
- * (27/Jun/2003) Ian Abbott
- *	Reworked the urb handling logic.  We have no more pool, but dynamically
- *	allocate the urb and the transfer buffer on the fly.  In testing this
- *	does not incure any measurable overhead.  This also relies on the fact
- *	that we have proper reference counting logic for urbs.  I nicked this
- *	from Greg KH's Visor driver.
- *
- * (23/Jun/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Reduced flip buffer pushes and corrected a data length test in
- *      ftdi_read_bulk_callback.
- *      Defererence pointers after any paranoid checks, not before.
- *
- * (21/Jun/2003) Erik Nygren
- *      Added support for Home Electronics Tira-1 IR transceiver using FT232BM chip.
- *      See <http://www.home-electro.com/tira1.htm>.  Only operates properly
- *      at 100000 and RTS-CTS, so set custom divisor mode on startup.
- *      Also force the Tira-1 and USB-UIRT to only use their custom baud rates.
- *
- * (18/Jun/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Added Device ID of the USB relais from Rudolf Gugler (backported from
- *      Philipp GÃ¼hring's patch for 2.5.x kernel).
- *      Moved read transfer buffer reallocation into startup function.
- *      Free existing write urb and transfer buffer in startup function.
- *      Only use urbs in write urb pool that were successfully allocated.
- *      Moved some constant macros out of functions.
- *      Minor whitespace and comment changes.
- *
- * (12/Jun/2003) David Norwood
- *      Added support for USB-UIRT IR transceiver using 8U232AM chip.
- *      See <http://home.earthlink.net/~jrhees/USBUIRT/index.htm>.  Only
- *      operates properly at 312500, so set custom divisor mode on startup.
- *
- * (12/Jun/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Added Sealevel SeaLINK+ 210x, 220x, 240x, 280x vid/pids from Tuan Hoang
- *      - I've eliminated some that don't seem to exist!
- *      Added Home Electronics Tira-1 IR transceiver pid from Chris Horn
- *      Some whitespace/coding-style cleanups
- *
- * (11/Jun/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Fixed unsafe spinlock usage in ftdi_write
- *
- * (24/Feb/2003) Richard Shooter
- *      Increase read buffer size to improve read speeds at higher baud rates
- *      (specifically tested with up to 1Mb/sec at 1.5M baud)
- *
- * (23/Feb/2003) John Wilkins
- *      Added Xon/xoff flow control (activating support in the ftdi device)
- *      Added vid/pid for Videonetworks/Homechoice (UK ISP)
- *
- * (23/Feb/2003) Bill Ryder
- *      Added matrix orb device vid/pids from Wayne Wylupski
- *
- * (19/Feb/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      For TIOCSSERIAL, set alt_speed to 0 when ASYNC_SPD_MASK value has
- *      changed to something other than ASYNC_SPD_HI, ASYNC_SPD_VHI,
- *      ASYNC_SPD_SHI or ASYNC_SPD_WARP.  Also, unless ASYNC_SPD_CUST is in
- *      force, don't bother changing baud rate when custom_divisor has changed.
- *
- * (18/Feb/2003) Ian Abbott
- *      Fixed TIOCMGET handling to include state of DTR and RTS, the state
- *      of which are now saved by set_dtr() and set_rts().
- *      Fixed improper storage class for buf in set_dtr() and set_rts().
- *      Added FT232BM chip type and support for its extra baud rates (compared
- *      to FT8U232AM).
- *      Took account of special case divisor values for highest baud rates of
- *      FT8U232AM and FT232BM.
- *      For TIOCSSERIAL, forced alt_speed to 0 when ASYNC_SPD_CUST kludge used,
- *      as previous alt_speed setting is now stale.
- *      Moved startup code common between the startup routines for the
- *      different chip types into a common subroutine.
- *
- * (17/Feb/2003) Bill Ryder
- *      Added write urb buffer pool on a per device basis
- *      Added more checking for open file on callbacks (fixed OOPS)
- *      Added CrystalFontz 632 and 634 PIDs
- *         (thanx to CrystalFontz for the sample devices - they flushed out
- *           some driver bugs)
- *      Minor debugging message changes
- *      Added throttle, unthrottle and chars_in_buffer functions
- *      Fixed FTDI_SIO (the original device) bug
- *      Fixed some shutdown handling
- *
- *
- *
- *
- * (07/Jun/2002) Kuba Ober
- *	Changed FTDI_SIO_BASE_BAUD_TO_DIVISOR macro into ftdi_baud_to_divisor
- *	function. It was getting too complex.
- *	Fix the divisor calculation logic which was setting divisor of 0.125
- *	instead of 0.5 for fractional parts of divisor equal to 5/8, 6/8, 7/8.
- *	Also make it bump up the divisor to next integer in case of 7/8 - it's
- *	a better approximation.
- *
- * (25/Jul/2002) Bill Ryder inserted Dmitri's TIOCMIWAIT patch
- *      Not tested by me but it doesn't break anything I use.
- *
- * (04/Jan/2002) Kuba Ober
- *	Implemented 38400 baudrate kludge, where it can be substituted with other
- *	  values. That's the only way to set custom baudrates.
- *	Implemented TIOCSSERIAL, TIOCGSERIAL ioctl's so that setserial is happy.
- *	FIXME: both baudrate things should eventually go to usbserial.c as other
- *	  devices may need that functionality too. Actually, it can probably be
- *	  merged in serial.c somehow - too many drivers repeat this code over
- *	  and over.
- *	Fixed baudrate forgetfulness - open() used to reset baudrate to 9600 every time.
- *	Divisors for baudrates are calculated by a macro.
- *	Small code cleanups. Ugly whitespace changes for Plato's sake only ;-].
- *
- * (04/Nov/2001) Bill Ryder
- *	Fixed bug in read_bulk_callback where incorrect urb buffer was used.
- *	Cleaned up write offset calculation
- *	Added write_room since default values can be incorrect for sio
- *	Changed write_bulk_callback to use same queue_task as other drivers
- *        (the previous version caused panics)
- *	Removed port iteration code since the device only has one I/O port and it
- *	  was wrong anyway.
- *
- * (31/May/2001) gkh
- *	Switched from using spinlock to a semaphore, which fixes lots of problems.
- *
- * (23/May/2001)   Bill Ryder
- *	Added runtime debug patch (thanx Tyson D Sawyer).
- *	Cleaned up comments for 8U232
- *	Added parity, framing and overrun error handling
- *	Added receive break handling.
- *
- * (04/08/2001) gb
- *	Identify version on module load.
- *
- * (18/March/2001) Bill Ryder
- *	(Not released)
- *	Added send break handling. (requires kernel patch too)
- *	Fixed 8U232AM hardware RTS/CTS etc status reporting.
- *	Added flipbuf fix copied from generic device
- *
- * (12/3/2000) Bill Ryder
- *	Added support for 8U232AM device.
- *	Moved PID and VIDs into header file only.
- *	Turned on low-latency for the tty (device will do high baudrates)
- *	Added shutdown routine to close files when device removed.
- *	More debug and error message cleanups.
- *
- * (11/13/2000) Bill Ryder
- *	Added spinlock protected open code and close code.
- *	Multiple opens work (sort of - see webpage mentioned above).
- *	Cleaned up comments. Removed multiple PID/VID definitions.
- *	Factorised cts/dtr code
- *	Made use of __FUNCTION__ in dbg's
- *
- * (11/01/2000) Adam J. Richter
- *	usb_device_id table support
- *
- * (10/05/2000) gkh
- *	Fixed bug with urb->dev not being set properly, now that the usb
- *	core needs it.
- *
- * (09/11/2000) gkh
- *	Removed DEBUG #ifdefs with call to usb_serial_debug_data
- *
- * (07/19/2000) gkh
- *	Added module_init and module_exit functions to handle the fact that this
- *	driver is a loadable module now.
- *
- * (04/04/2000) Bill Ryder
- *	Fixed bugs in TCGET/TCSET ioctls (by removing them - they are
- *        handled elsewhere in the tty io driver chain).
- *
- * (03/30/2000) Bill Ryder
- *	Implemented lots of ioctls
- *	Fixed a race condition in write
- *	Changed some dbg's to errs
- *
- * (03/26/2000) gkh
- *	Split driver up into device specific pieces.
+ * Change entries from 2004 and earlier can be found in versions of this
+ * file in kernel versions prior to the 2.6.24 release.
