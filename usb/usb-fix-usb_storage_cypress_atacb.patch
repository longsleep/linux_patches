commit 64a87b24: [SCSI] Let scsi_cmnd->cmnd use request->cmd buffer
changed the scsi_eh_prep_cmnd logic by making it clear
the ->cmnd buffer. But the sat to cypress atacb translation supposed
the ->cmnd buffer wasn't modified.

This patch makes it set the ->cmnd buffer after scsi_eh_prep_cmnd call.
The problem and a fix was reported by Matthieu CASTET <castet.matthieu@free.fr>

It also removes all the hackery fiddling of scsi_cmnd and scsi_eh_save by
requesting from scsi_eh_prep_cmnd to prepare a read into ->sense_buffer,
which is much more suitable a buffer for HW transfers, then after the command
execution the regs read is copied into regs buffer before actual preparation
of sense_buffer.

Also fix an alien comment character to my utf-8 editor.
