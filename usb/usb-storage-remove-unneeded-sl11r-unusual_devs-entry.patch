Subject: USB: storage: Remove unneeded SL11R unusual_devs entry
To: Greg KH <greg@kroah.com>
Cc: Matthew Dharm <mdharm-usb@one-eyed-alien.net>,  USB Dev <linux-usb@vger.kernel.org>, USB Storage list <usb-storage@lists.one-eyed-alien.net>

It seems unlikely that this entry is needed anymore since the kernel
has logic to handle devices that poorly respond to INQUIRY. Since we
now have another entry with the same VID/PID but different flags, it's
a good time to attempt to clean this up.

The original submitter's email no longer works, so we'll keep an eye
out for any regression reports.
