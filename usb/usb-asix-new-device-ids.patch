Subject: USB: asix: new device ids

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

This patch adds two new device ids to the asix driver.

One comes directly from the asix driver on their web site, the other was
reported by Armani Liao as needed for the MSI X320 to get the driver to
work properly for it.
