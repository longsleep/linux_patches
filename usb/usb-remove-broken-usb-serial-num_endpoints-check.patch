Subject: USB: remove broken usb-serial num_endpoints check

The num_interrupt_in, num_bulk_in, and other checks in the usb-serial
code are just wrong, there are too many different devices out there with
different numbers of endpoints.  We need to just be sticking with the
device ids instead of trying to catch this kind of thing.  It broke too
many different devices.

This fixes a large number of usb-serial devices to get them working
properly again.
